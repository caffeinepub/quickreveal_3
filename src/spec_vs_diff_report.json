  "summary": "AppV1.jsx was heavily modified and includes local-only state with persistence to the required localStorage key. However, the change set also modifies non-requested meta/documentation files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json). From the truncated diff, there’s no evidence of backend/Internet Identity usage being introduced, and App.tsx is not shown as changed.",
