  "summary": "AppV1.jsx was heavily rewritten toward a local-only NEXUS-style app with mock datasets and localStorage persistence, but the diff is truncated so key V7000-specific requirements (verbatim match, full discovery engine + list↔map, Framer Motion modal animation) cannot be confirmed. Two ancillary files (frontend-file-summaries.txt, project_state.json) were modified even though the request focused on replacing AppV1.jsx and preserving entry wiring.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-289",
      "requirement": "Completely delete the current contents of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` and replace the entire file with the exact V7000 “NEXUS INFINITY” code provided by the user (verbatim), including discovery engine (category rail + distance sort toggle + list/map dual view), bottom dock, booking modal overlay, datasets (`CATEGORIES`, `PRO_DB`), and localStorage brain (`nexus_v7000`).",
      "reason": "The file is truncated in the diff summary, and the provided snippet does not show the full V7000 UI/logic pieces (e.g., list↔map dual view, distance sort toggle, bottom dock, booking modal overlay). Also, the snippet includes custom additions (e.g., design tokens) that may or may not exist in the user-provided verbatim V7000 block; verbatim equivalence cannot be validated from the truncated content.",

      "reason": "In the visible snippet, Lucide icons (including `Navigation as NavIcon`) are imported, but there is no visible `framer-motion` import or usage (`motion`, `AnimatePresence`). This may exist later in the truncated portion, but it cannot be confirmed from the diff summary.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not show changes to `frontend/src/App.tsx` or `frontend/src/main.tsx`, but since only modified files are listed and these are not among them, this appears satisfied; however, the diff summary does not explicitly show the absence of changes to all immutable entry files beyond those two, so full compliance cannot be proven from the provided evidence.",
