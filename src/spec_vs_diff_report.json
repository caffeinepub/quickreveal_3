  "summary": "Diff shows `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` was significantly rewritten toward a local-only V10000-style app with `localStorage` persistence using the `nexus_omniverse_v10000` key. However, because the file content is truncated and the exact user-provided V10000 code block is not present in the diff summary, full-verbatim replacement and full compile/run compliance cannot be confirmed from the evidence. Two additional non-requested files (`frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`) were modified.",

      "requirement": "Completely delete the current contents of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` and replace the entire file with the exact V10000 “NEXUS OMNIVERSE” code provided by the user (full overwrite), preserving all components, local mock data/constants, imports, Tailwind classes, UI strings, and interaction logic as given.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a rewritten `AppV1.jsx`, but the content is truncated and does not provide enough evidence to confirm the file matches the *exact* user-provided V10000 code block verbatim as required.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not include build/run results or enough of the final `AppV1.jsx` to verify all referenced identifiers/imports are resolved and that `npm run build` / `npm run dev` succeed without runtime crashes.",
