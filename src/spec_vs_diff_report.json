  "summary": "The diff shows a substantial rewrite of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx`, but the provided diff is truncated, so key V54-specific behaviors (manifesto intro cycling text, share + WhatsApp bridge, and robust deploy insertion) cannot be conclusively verified from the available evidence. Two additional non-requested metadata/state files were modified.",
