  "summary": "Diff adds a local Aura generator utility and updates AppV1.jsx and global CSS with multiple new animations (including heartbeat). However, due to truncation of AppV1.jsx and absence of explicit evidence for several behaviors, multiple V25 pillar requirements cannot be verified as implemented from the provided diff summary.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-88",
      "requirement": "Fully replace (overwrite) `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with the exact user-provided V25 “AETHER GENESIS” code block.",
      "reason": "The diff shows `AppV1.jsx` was modified, but the content is truncated and includes an added import (`generateAura`) that makes it impossible to verify the file is an exact verbatim overwrite of the user-provided V25 code block.",

        "frontend/src/AppV1.jsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-89",
      "requirement": "Apply only minimal mechanical fixes required to compile and run with the pasted V25 code (no unresolved identifiers/imports).",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not provide enough information to confirm all referenced identifiers/imports resolve and that the build succeeds (AppV1.jsx is truncated; no build/tsconfig/eslint evidence shown).",

        "frontend/src/AppV1.jsx"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-90",
      "requirement": "Helix navigation filters salon feed instantly by category selection, including “Tout”, and shows an explicit empty state when no match.",
      "reason": "HelixNav buttons and categories are shown, but the actual filtering logic, salon feed rendering, and empty-state rendering are not visible in the truncated AppV1.jsx snippet.",

      "requirement": "Living Matter card behaviors: (1) swipe/drag gallery, (2) fused magazine-style bio+contact block, (3) pulsing availability dots driven by local slot list.",
      "reason": "The CSS includes a heartbeat animation and the DATA includes `availabilities`, but the diff summary does not show (a) swipe/drag gallery implementation, (b) the composed editorial bio+contact presentation in expanded view, or (c) actual rendering of pulsing dot indicators bound to availability data.",

      "id": "REQ-92",
      "requirement": "Creator Cockpit upgrades: Live Preview (split view desktop, modal/sheet mobile) and an AI Assist button generating Aura locally.",
      "reason": "A local Aura generator was added, but the diff summary does not show Creator Cockpit UI changes for live preview (split view/modal) or a wired “AI Assist” button inserting generated text into the form field.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-93",
      "requirement": "Deploy uses functional state update to avoid stale closures and inserts new salon at top reliably.",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not show the deploy handler or state update code for `salons`, so it cannot be verified that a functional state update (`setSalons(prev => ...)`) is used and that new salons are inserted at the top.",
