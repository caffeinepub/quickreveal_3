Because `AppV1.jsx` content is truncated, the diff summary does not provide enough evidence to confirm a verbatim V51 overwrite or the presence of all required V51 engines/flows, nor that only minimal mechanical fixes were applied.",

      "reason": "The diff summary shows only a truncated portion of `AppV1.jsx`, so it cannot be verified that the file is an exact verbatim overwrite of the user-provided V51 block, nor that all four engines (navigator.share, WhatsApp deep-link booking, Swiss ZIP↔city suggestions, dark luxury styling) are present as coded.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not include build output and `AppV1.jsx` is truncated, so there is insufficient evidence that changes were strictly mechanical, that the app compiles, and that Landing/Client/Pro navigation works without runtime crash.",
