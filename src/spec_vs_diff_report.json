  "summary": "Diff shows a large replacement of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` consistent with an “ETHEREAL” UI and updates to global CSS utilities/animations. However, because `AppV1.jsx` is truncated in the diff, key acceptance-criteria behaviors (full flow, overlays, Pro deploy stale-closure fix) cannot be verified from the provided evidence. Two non-requested metadata/state files were also modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-109",
      "requirement": "Fully overwrite `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with the user-provided V34 code block end-to-end (not partial merge) and preserve the full V34 flow/behaviors (Landing → Client feed with sticky capsules + floating island → detail overlay with shared layoutId transitions + reachable booking CTA → Pro split studio).",
      "reason": "`frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` is truncated in the diff, so it is not possible to confirm end-to-end overwrite nor the presence of the specified V34 flow elements (landing boot view, capsule filters + floating island nav, shared `layoutId` transitions, booking CTA placement, and split Pro studio behavior).",

      "requirement": "Fix Pro “Deploy” to use functional state update `setSalons(prev => [newSalon, ...prev])` to prevent stale closures, while switching view to Client immediately.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt does not include the Pro studio `handleDeploy` implementation or any `setSalons(prev => ...)` evidence, so the stale-closure prevention cannot be verified.",

      "description": "Added/expanded extensive global theme tokens (OKLCH variables) and multiple animation keyframes/utility classes in `frontend/src/index.css` beyond the explicitly mentioned `.hide-scrollbar` continuity requirement.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest did not ask to redesign global theming or add new animations; only required that `.hide-scrollbar` continues to work. These CSS additions may be unrequested unless they were explicitly part of the provided V34 code (not shown in the diff context).",
