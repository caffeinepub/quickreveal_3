  "summary": "Diff shows partial update to `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` introducing V66-like constants (`INITIAL_ARTISTS`, `PRESETS`) and a `MirrorProtocol` component, but the file is truncated so core flow requirements (sequential booking tunnel, Creator Studio deploy path, and Mirror gating) cannot be verified. Two additional files (`frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`) were modified without being requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-208",
      "requirement": "Completely overwrite `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with the exact user-provided V66 “NEXUS FREEDOM” code (full app UI/logic) and keep app local-only (no backend calls).",
      "reason": "The diff shows `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` changed and includes V66-like pieces, but the file content is truncated and does not provide evidence that the entire file was replaced with the exact provided V66 code (verbatim components/strings/classes) or that no backend calls/hooks exist elsewhere in the file.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the V66 implementation compiles via minimal mechanical fixes (correct imports/identifiers; no immutable entry changes).",
      "reason": "Only partial import/JSX evidence is shown; build success and absence of missing/undefined symbols across the full file cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff. Also, the diff does not include `frontend/src/App.tsx`, so we cannot verify it remained unchanged.",

      "id": "REQ-212",
      "requirement": "Use functional state update for `setArtists` in deploy path to avoid stale closures; preserve behavior.",

      "requirement": "Mirror Protocol only accessible after final booked ticket; “Pay (Mirror)” opens MirrorProtocol with correct total; onFinish closes and resets/returns to feed.",
      "reason": "While `MirrorProtocol` component exists, the diff snippet does not show how/when it is opened, whether it is gated to only the Final ticket screen, whether amount is derived from selected services, or whether completion resets/returns to feed.",
