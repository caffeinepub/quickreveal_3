  "summary": "The diff shows a partial overwrite of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with new UI code (including a `DATA` constant and an orbital-style `CoreNav` component) plus significant updates to `frontend/src/index.css` (adding animation keyframes/utilities). However, due to truncation and missing evidence (notably no visible Framer Motion imports/`layoutId` usage, no visible category slider/filtering logic, and no visible Landing→Client→Pro/GenesisEngine flow), multiple REQ-86 acceptance criteria cannot be verified and may be missing.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-86",
      "requirement": "Use Framer Motion shared `layoutId` to morph a compact salon card into a full-screen expanded view in the Client Home tab (no route/page navigation).",
      "reason": "In the visible portion of `AppV1.jsx`, there is no import from `framer-motion` and no evidence of `layoutId` usage; truncation prevents confirming it exists later in the file.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-86",
      "requirement": "Include the top category slider that controls filtering immediately, per the provided V24 styling/behavior.",
      "reason": "The truncated snippet shows `DATA` and `CoreNav`, but no category slider UI or filtering logic is visible; cannot confirm it was implemented.",

      "requirement": "Completely replace `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with the exact V24 “OMEGA SINGULARITY” code provided by the user (verbatim, no refactors/additions), including the full Landing → Client → Pro/GenesisEngine flow.",
      "reason": "The file is truncated, so it is not possible to verify it is an exact full overwrite or that the full multi-stage flow (Landing/Client/Pro/GenesisEngine) is present and matches the provided V24 code exactly.",

      "id": "REQ-87",
      "requirement": "Ensure the project compiles after the overwrite with only minimal mechanical fixes (e.g., fix missing imports/unresolved symbols) without changing intended behavior.",
      "reason": "Because `AppV1.jsx` is truncated and shows no Framer Motion import despite REQ-86 requiring it, there is insufficient evidence that all required imports/symbols are resolved and that the build succeeds.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/AppV1.jsx (truncated; no `framer-motion` import visible)",
