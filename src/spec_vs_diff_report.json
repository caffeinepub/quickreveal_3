  "summary": "The diff clearly modifies `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx`, but due to truncation it’s not possible to verify several requested behavioral details (deploy functional state update, precise booking gating/pending screen, full Service Studio V2 functionality) from the provided excerpt alone. Two auxiliary metadata/state files were also modified, which were not requested by the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest requirements focus on overwriting `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` and making minimal mechanical fixes for build stability and specific UI behaviors; it does not request changes to project metadata/state summary files.",
