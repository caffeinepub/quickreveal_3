  "summary": "The diff shows `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` was modified and two project metadata/summary files were also modified. Due to truncation and lack of the user-provided V61 code block in the diff evidence, it’s not possible to verify key requirements like verbatim overwrite, Pro Studio flows, or the functional `setSalons` update from the provided snippet.",
