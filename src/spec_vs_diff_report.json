  "summary": "Diff shows substantial new V14-style UI code added to `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` plus additional styling/metadata changes. However, because `AppV1.jsx` is truncated and the provided V14 code block is not included in the BuildRequest payload here, the diff summary does not allow verification that the overwrite is verbatim or that all specified client/pro behaviors are implemented exactly as required. Several non-requested files were also modified (`index.css`, `frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`).",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "requirement": "Replace the entire contents of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with the user-provided V14 “DIVINE OS” code block exactly as given (verbatim), with a full overwrite of the file.",
      "reason": "The diff for `AppV1.jsx` is truncated and the actual user-provided V14 code block is not present in the BuildRequest text here, so there is insufficient evidence that the file matches the provided code verbatim and was fully overwritten (no partial merges).",

      "id": "REQ-65",
      "requirement": "No backend calls are introduced by the new `AppV1` implementation; all behavior is driven by local React state only.",
      "reason": "The `AppV1.jsx` diff is truncated, so the summary does not conclusively show whether any backend/canister/actor/react-query calls were added elsewhere in the file.",

      "reason": "The provided snippet includes only component/data definitions (e.g., `INITIAL_SALONS`, `StoriesRail`, `DivineCard`) and is truncated before showing the top-level app component, initial route/screen selection, and flow switching logic.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the application compiles and runs after the `AppV1.jsx` overwrite while preserving the injected UI/behavior; keep `frontend/src/App.tsx` as the thin wrapper that renders `AppV1`.",
      "reason": "`frontend/src/App.tsx` is not shown as modified in the diff, but the diff summary does not include the file content, so it cannot be verified (from evidence provided) that it remains a thin wrapper rendering `AppV1` and that no wiring changes were made elsewhere that impact compilation/runtime.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not include the relevant parts of `AppV1.jsx` (truncated) where state, tabs (Favorites/Agenda), handlers (heart/trash/service click), and ProWizard deploy injection would be implemented, so these acceptance criteria cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",
