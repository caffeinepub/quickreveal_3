  "summary": "Diff shows updates to `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` consistent with a V38-style local-state UI (imports, `INITIAL_SALONS`, `PRESETS`, and client components are present), but the provided diff is truncated and does not include key sections needed to verify the full overwrite requirement or the specific `handleDeploy` functional state update. Two additional project metadata/state files were modified without being requested in the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-119",
      "requirement": "Completely overwrite `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with the exact provided V38 “GENESIS ARCHITECT” code block (verbatim), including Smart Presets, Detailed Service Studio, and split-view live preview behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff for `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` is truncated and does not show the complete file contents (including the Pro Studio area, split-view layout, navigation flow Landing→Client→Pro, and the exact verbatim code block). As a result, a full overwrite and the presence of all required V38 behaviors cannot be verified from the provided evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-120",
      "requirement": "Ensure the V38 app compiles/runs with only minimal mechanical adjustments (no UI/UX behavior changes; no immutable entry file changes).",
      "reason": "The diff summary does not provide build output or enough code context to confirm compilation/runtime success, nor does it show what mechanical adjustments (if any) were required beyond the partial snippet. Immutable entry files are not shown as modified, but successful build/no runtime crash cannot be verified from the truncated snippet alone.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-121",
      "requirement": "Update V38 `handleDeploy` to use functional state update: `setSalons(prev => [newSalon, ...prev])` to avoid stale closures, preserving identical visible behavior.",
      "reason": "`handleDeploy` is not visible in the truncated `AppV1.jsx` snippet, so it cannot be verified that `setSalons` uses the required functional updater form.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asks for a frontend UI overwrite in `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` plus minimal build-fixing adjustments. Updating a file-summary/metadata document is not requested and is not necessary to satisfy the UI requirements based on the diff summary alone.",

    {
      "description": "Modified `project_state.json` (project tracking/state metadata).",
