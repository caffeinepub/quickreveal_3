  "summary": "Diff shows `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` was modified with a substantial V45-style UI (lucide-react imports, local seed data, gradient/glassmorphism card styling). However, because the file content is truncated and the user-provided V45 code block is not included here, the diff summary is insufficient to verify the “exact full-file replacement” requirement or the specific V45 visual/UX acceptance criteria. Two additional files (`frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`) were modified without being requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "`frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` is truncated in the diff summary, and the referenced user-provided V45 code block is not present in the provided materials, so an exact/verbatim full-file match cannot be verified from the diff summary alone.",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not provide evidence of build success (`npm run build`) or absence of runtime errors, and the AppV1 implementation is truncated so potential build-breaking issues (e.g., missing components/exports/references later in file) cannot be assessed.",

      "reason": "While the truncated snippet shows some gradient/glass styling on a card, the diff summary does not include the Salon/Domicile selector implementation or the Pro landing view, so the specific visual acceptance criteria cannot be verified.",
