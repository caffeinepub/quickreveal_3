However, the AppV1 diff is truncated, so key acceptance criteria (full verbatim overwrite and the functional `setSalons(prev => ...)` publish injection) cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",

      "reason": "The `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` content is truncated in the diff summary, so it’s not possible to verify a complete verbatim overwrite of the entire file (and that all specified flows/logic from the user-provided V37 block are present exactly).",
