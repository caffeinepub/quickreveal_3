  "summary": "The diff modifies AppV1.jsx and adds substantial new CSS animations and global style variables in index.css, plus updates to project metadata files. Based on the visible snippets, the AppV1.jsx implementation does not appear to be the exact verbatim V60 code (notably Framer Motion/layoutId is not evidenced), and the extra styling/metadata changes go beyond the requested minimal mechanical fixes.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-191",
      "requirement": "Completely delete the current contents of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` and replace the entire file with the exact V60 “NEXUS DIVINE” code block provided by the user (verbatim), including Framer Motion `layoutId` morphing and the specified flows/effects.",
      "reason": "The shown AppV1.jsx snippet contains lucide-react imports and custom CSS-class-based animation hooks; there is no evidence of the required Framer Motion imports/usage or `layoutId` morphing. Additionally, comments/content suggest the file is not a verbatim paste of the user-provided V60 block.",

        "frontend/src/AppV1.jsx (truncated snippet shows lucide-react imports; no framer-motion/layoutId evidenced)",

      "requirement": "Ensure the project compiles and runs after the V60 AppV1.jsx overwrite by applying only minimal mechanical fixes required by this repository, without changing intended V60 UI/UX, copy, data, or interaction behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff includes broad, non-mechanical changes (large new global CSS variables and many new keyframes, plus updates to metadata/state files), which are not clearly limited to build-breaking fixes and may alter the UI/UX beyond the V60 code.",
      "evidence": [

      "reason": "The BuildRequest requires the V60 code as provided (including Framer Motion `layoutId` morphing) and restricts changes to minimal mechanical fixes; introducing a CSS-based replacement is an unrequested architectural/UI behavior change.",
