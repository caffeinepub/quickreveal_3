  "summary": "`frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` was heavily changed and now contains SWISS_DB, SHOWREEL, INITIAL_SALONS, PROFESSIONS, and RICH_PRESETS consistent with the V53 “NEXUS OLYMPUS” direction, but the diff is truncated so exact verbatim overwrite and the full set of required behaviors (share, WhatsApp booking link, location suggestions, full-screen intro gating) cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence. Two additional non-requested files were modified (`frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`).",

      "reason": "Only the top portion of `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` is visible. While `SWISS_DB` and `SHOWREEL` constants are present, there is no visible evidence (in the truncated excerpt) of the actual intro gating UI, `navigator.share` usage/fallback, WhatsApp `wa.me` link generation, or the location-suggestion filtering logic wired to an input.",
