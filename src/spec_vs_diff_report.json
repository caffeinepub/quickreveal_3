  "summary": "Diff shows a new V26-themed implementation starting in `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` (Quantum DATA + `SingularityLoader` long-press entry mechanics). However, due to truncation and lack of evidence for key sections, several V26 requirements cannot be verified from the provided diff summary. Two non-requested metadata/documentation files were also modified.",

      "id": "REQ-94",
      "requirement": "Completely overwrite `frontend/src/AppV1.jsx` with the exact V26 “QUANTUM REALITY” code provided by the user, and boot through `frontend/src/App.tsx` thin wrapper rendering `AppV1`.",
      "reason": "The diff for `AppV1.jsx` is truncated and does not allow verification that the file was replaced in full with the *exact* user-provided V26 code, nor does it show any evidence about `frontend/src/App.tsx` being unchanged/thin in this change set.",

      "requirement": "Ensure the project compiles/runs after the overwrite with only minimal mechanical fixes; all referenced symbols resolve; do not change immutable entry files; `App.tsx` remains a thin wrapper rendering `AppV1`.",
      "reason": "No build/CI output is provided, `AppV1.jsx` is truncated (cannot confirm all symbols/imports resolve across the whole file), and there is no direct diff evidence confirming immutable entry files were not modified or that `App.tsx` remains unchanged.",

      "reason": "Hold-to-charge and release-to-reset behavior is evidenced, but the diff is truncated before showing the full orb UI and any explicit aspiration/pull-in transition implementation beyond a basic opacity/scale change.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/AppV1.jsx (shows `SingularityLoader` with `onMouseDown`/`onMouseUp`/`onTouchStart`/`onTouchEnd`, `setProgress(0)` on stop; transition class `opacity-0 scale-95` when entering; remainder truncated)"
